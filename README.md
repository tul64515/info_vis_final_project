Introduction
- Every day there's over 30,000 crashes in the United States with the leading cause being aggressive driving.
- Our goal is to spread awareness for the dangers of driving and get people to be more aware while driving.

- We used data from OpenPhillyData to create several visualizations that help us show how dangerous driving really is and what are the leading causes.
- We also have a heat map of the crashes that occur in Philly.

Installation / Setup
- You can view the visualization simply by visiting https://tul64515.github.io/info_vis_final_project/
- If you want to run it locally simply download the code
- Using live server you can run the html page and everything should be displayed

Lessons
- Communication was really important in creating a cohesive dashboard
- It's better to think about the problem and have a plan before coding
- How we deliver our message and styling of our webpage may have been just as important as the visualizations we created to the audience
